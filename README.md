# sodoku-api

## A small app w/ backend to solve any Sodoku using an api.

### Having grown more and more competent with the front-end since graduation last December (React, Boostrap, CSS, Javascript fundamentals and algorithms); I feel comfortable enough to move on to expanding my confidence with back-end and APIs.

### I found this API from [RapidAPI](https://www.rapidapi.com)

###The back-end will be built using:
- axios
- express
- cors
